Use Case: Configuration Manager
Scenario:
You have an application that requires various configuration settings (e.g., database connection details, API keys, etc.).
These settings need to be loaded once and accessed globally across the application.

This pattern is used to coordinate actions and resources across the system in a controlled and consistent manner.


The intuition behind the Singleton Design Pattern is to control the creation of an object to ensure that only
one instance of the class exists throughout the application's lifecycle.


Steps to Implement the Singleton Design Pattern
1.Create the Singleton Class: Define a class ConfigurationManager with a private constructor, a private static instance, and a public static method to get the instance.
2.Load Configuration: Add a method to load configuration settings from a file.
3.Provide Access to Configuration: Add methods to get specific configuration values.


The private static instance variable holds the single instance of the class.
The private constructor prevents direct instantiation from other classes.
The public static method controls the instantiation process, ensuring that only one instance is created and provides a global access point to this instance.
